  <p><b>Hi, my name is Stjepan</b>. I am a curious human being exploring myself and the world through art and travel. By challenging myself to draw, take photos, read, do something different every day I am trying to grow as a person. If you're curious, read <saber-link to="/my-story">my story</saber-link> or find out what I am doing <saber-link to="/my-story">now</saber-link>.</p>
  <p class="short"><b>I am also a digital product designer</b> with over six years of experience working in both startups and advertising agencies.  Iâ€™ve been fortunate enough to work with great companies and even greater people. I shaped products and helped companies grow. If you wonder how that looks like, check out <saber-link to="/my">my work</saber-link> or read my <saber-link to="/my-story">resume</saber-link>.</p>
