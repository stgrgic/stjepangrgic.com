<b>I would oftenly wonder, what this person did</b>, how they managed to do that. How his/her life looked like.

Inspired by Siver's now page, I decided to make My story page where I will answer to my own questions.

That was my first thought after an idea of writing a blog came to my mind. And that idea appeared after my first big solo travel trip. It was Jordan, and it was life changing. After that, I have started to look at the world with different eyes. You can read more about my first trip here.
That trip happened at the beginning of 2016 and since then so many things happened to me that my brain started to hurt. And I had to start writing.
But there was a problem. I never wrote anything before. At least not like writing travel stories and trying to express how travel changed me. I had no idea how to write or how to start. And even worse, English is not my primary language and I have a mild form of dyslexia. Which means I have a hard time reading and I haven’t read so much to feel I can write anything.
But I have said to myself, don’t be a stupid wimp, just start writing what’s in your head, just like you would speak. It was easier said than done. But I tried. And this is me doing.

## It will be about life, travel, learning, experiences, friends, people and the road.
This is me trying to express everything that I experienced and everything that changed me. In hopes, someone of you might get the courage to go and explore or to realize that you don’t need courage, just some scary lust that would lead you on the road.
All my writings will be filled with photographs. This is the best that I know how to do. So even if I don’t express myself in the best way, maybe photos will fill that gap.
