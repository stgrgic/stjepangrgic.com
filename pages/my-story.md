### Is this useful?
When I stumble upon interesting people on the internet, I wonder how they became what they are. What decision they made in life. How they educated themselves, do they have book recommendations. Have they overcome any struggle, do they have a story to share. Unlike [Sivers](https://sivers.org/about), I found it all useful. I found every story inspirational and educative. I get insight into how their lives looked like so I can understand how mine could look like. I see what humans can do, how different ways of thinking lead to different outcomes. It's truly useful.
