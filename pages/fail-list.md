Having a bucket list is important, but having a fail list, colection of misteps, fails, mistakes, make me avare of stuff I wish I did differentyl.
List of failures in life I made that remind me not to make them again.

I should learn from my own failures
I knew I want to write bucket list on the site. But then I realized failures are maybe more important. The list will defiantly grow with time. But it will be my reminder not to make fail again. I will write posts for some of the failures eventually.

I failed to
Keep friends
Love more
Call my parents more often
Spent more time with my sister when she was younger
Fight with my brother less when we were younger
â€¦ and more. I will write about them.
