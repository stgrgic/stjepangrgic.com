<!-- ### Building this personal site / portfolio
For some time now I was avare of how much imposter sindrom I have suffered. I have been extremly unopened with sharing anything with the world. And for last couple of moonts I have been trying to shutter ground below my feet. I was trying to break my inconfidences. -->

### Moving to London.
I decided [Zagreb](https://www.google.com/search?q=Zagreb) is no longer a place for me. It's really a small city, and as I've been living there for the last nine years, I was getting bored. I needed a change. So after a few considered places, London seamed the perfect place to go.

However moving anywhere, especially moving to a different country, is no small decision. So, for a long time, I was hesitant to even think about moving. I was too comfortable. I realized I had to approach it differently. Instead of finding a job and a place to live before moving, I decided to move and figure out stuff as I go along. I made a leap, and now I'm writing this from London. Besides, I feel it is an excellent way to get confident about working and living here as I visited London only two times before. I will write more about the whole process once I am somewhat settled.

<b>I'm also searching for a job in London</b>. As I am more experienced than before, I'm not looking for the first boat to jump in. So I have set myself a few specific requirements that I am looking for:
- company solving a real-life problem
- creatively and technically challenging position
- place where I am going to be surrounded by smart people
- team of designers I can learn from
- place where I can make new friendships
- place where I can stay for a longer time <!-- - [Here is why](/freelancing-is-not-for-everyone) -->

### Reading
I am currently reading two books:
- [David and Goliath](https://www.gladwellbooks.com/titles/malcolm-gladwell/david-and-goliath/9780316204361/) by Malcolm Gladwell
- [The 4-Hour Work Week](https://www.amazon.com/4-Hour-Workweek-Escape-Live-Anywhere/dp/0307465357/?tag=offsitoftimfe-20) by Timothy Ferriss

Check out my [favourite books](/book-list) or find out [how I learned to read](/how-I-learned-to-read).

<!-- I have also started a few more, but they stayed with a friend of mine. There was no more space in my bags to London. Why am I reading more than one book at the time? Read [here](/how-I-learned-to-read). -->
