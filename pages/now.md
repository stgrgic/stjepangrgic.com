### Moving to London.
I decided [Zagreb](https://www.google.com/search?q=zagreb) is no longer a place for me. I have been living there for the last nine years, and as I write it, I can't believe it's been that long. Zagreb is small and the same streets, same people same everything started to bother me. I needed a change. So after a few considered places, London seamed the perfect place to go.

However moving anywhere, especially moving to a different country, is no small decision. So for a long time, I was hesitant to even think about moving. I was too comfortable. I realized I had to approach it differently. Instead of finding a job, place to live... before moving, I decided to come here and figure out stuff as I go along. I made a leap, and now I am writing this from London. I will write more about the whole process once I am somewhat settled.

<b>I am also searching for a job in London</b>, and I have specific requirements that I am looking for:
- a creatively and technically challenging position
- a place where I am going to be surrounded by smart people
- team of designers from whom I can learn
- a place where I can find new friendships
- a place where I can stay for a longer time <!-- - [Here is why](/freelancing-is-not-for-everyone) -->

### Reading
I am currently reading two books:
- [David and Goliath](https://www.gladwellbooks.com/titles/malcolm-gladwell/david-and-goliath/9780316204361/) by Malcolm Gladwell
- [The 4-Hour Work Week](https://www.amazon.com/4-Hour-Workweek-Escape-Live-Anywhere/dp/0307465357/?tag=offsitoftimfe-20) by Timothy Ferriss

<!-- I have also started a few more, but they stayed with a friend of mine. There was no more space in my bags to London. Why am I reading more than one book at the time? Read [here](/how-I-learned-to-read). -->
