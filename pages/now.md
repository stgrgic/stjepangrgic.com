<!-- ### Building this personal site / portfolio
For some time now I was avare of how much imposter sindrom I have suffered. I have been extremly unopened with sharing anything with the world. And for last couple of moonts I have been trying to shutter ground below my feet. I was trying to break my inconfidences. -->

### Moving to London.
I decided [Zagreb](https://www.google.com/search?q=Zagreb) is no longer a place for me. It's really a small city, and as I've been living there for the last nine years, I was getting bored. I needed a change. So after a few considered places, London seamed the perfect place to go.

However moving anywhere, especially moving to a different country, is no small decision. So, for a long time, I was hesitant to even think about moving. I was too comfortable. I realized I had to approach it differently. Instead of finding a job and a place to live before moving, I decided to move and figure out stuff as I go along. I made a leap, and now I'm writing this from London. Besides, I feel it is an excellent way to get confident about working and living here as I visited London only two times before. I will write more about the whole process once I am somewhat settled.

### Looking for a job in London
I have a few requirements that I am looking for:
- a company solving a real-life problem
- a creatively and technically challenging position
- a place where I am going to be surrounded by smart people and a team of designers I can learn from
- a place where I can make new friendships
- a place where I can stay for a longer time 

Setting some requirements for myself is, I feel, critical for finding a longlasting position. When I was younger, I would often jump on the first opportunity I got. So few times I wasn't happy with a place I ended up at. That was fine then, but now I'm not in a rush. I want to do great and fulfiling work, have a responsibility, learn, and improve.

If you think your position meets the requirements or have a company to recommend, feel free to contact me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stjepangrgic/).


### Reading
I am currently reading two books:
- [David and Goliath](https://www.gladwellbooks.com/titles/malcolm-gladwell/david-and-goliath/9780316204361/) by Malcolm Gladwell
- [The 4-Hour Work Week](https://www.amazon.com/4-Hour-Workweek-Escape-Live-Anywhere/dp/0307465357/?tag=offsitoftimfe-20) by Timothy Ferriss
- [Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0062316117/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_U_avMGDbDQ9MCEX) my Yuval Noah Harari

<!-- I have also started a few more, but they stayed with a friend of mine. There was no more space in my bags to London. Why am I reading more than one book at the time? Read [here](/how-I-learned-to-read). -->
