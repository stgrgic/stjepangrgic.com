### Build details and tooling
I built this stite using [Saber](https://saber.land/), a [Gatsby](http://gatsbyjs.org) like static site generator built by [EGOIST](https://egoist.sh/).It is still very early project but I found it very flexible and simple for a site like this one.

It is hosted on [Netlify]() and source code is available on [GitHub]().
