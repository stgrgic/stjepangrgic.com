## Introduction
Agrivi is agritech startup with a promis of solving world food problem by providing farmers with knowledge-based software solutions. 

### My role
Being only designer in a small team with big dreams is a lot of work. I knew that. But griwing up in countriside souranded with crops and domestic animals I understod painpoints that farmers face. So I decided to join and design products that will solve actual problems . I was involved in whol product cycle, from branding to web and mobile aplications all the way to ads.

### The chalange
As it goes, startups donâ€™t spend a lot of time making apps understandable and easy to use, let alone beautifull. It just has to work and prove the concept. That was the case at the time I joined the company. No consistent branding and poor web app experience.

So the challenge was: rethink company branding, build flexible and lightwaight design system capable of adapting to web an mobile enviroments all while having farmers in mind.

## Branding
Everythin Agrivi was using at the time was few stock icons and logo made from stuf downloaded from internet (nothing new for a sturtup). But logo had a strong idea that I wanted to build upon.

### Colors
Thinking about primary colors green was an obvious choice. But it had to be warm and inviting.  As a young plant lit with warm morning sunshine.

### The logomark
I wanted to incorporate idea of a young plant. To symbolize agriculture and something to take care of. It was also idea of a startup -  young growing company.

Perfection of nature reflets in fibonacy numbers. So I constructed two stylized leafs  using the proportions present in nature.

### Typography
To quote the fonts autor: "Sofia Pro is a geometric sans font family who dares the modernism and the harmony of the curves". To me it beautifuly reflected perfection of nature i was looking for.
