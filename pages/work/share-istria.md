## Introduction
As part of a design team in digital marketing agency Grey Entourage, I worked on creating a influencer oriented marketing campaign called Share Istria for the client Istrian Tourist Board.

### Campaign goal
Promote and raise awareness of Istria (distinctive geographic region of Croatia). How? By using travel influencers, which was, at the time, an innovative approach to digital marketing. The team came up with a story and mechanic on how to get influencers to come to Istria and share as much valuable content as possible.

### My role
This was the first important project I was able to get my hands on while working in the agency.  At the time, I was a young and inexperienced designer (I was 22) so I embraced the possibility that my work would not be accepted. Nonetheless, I liked the project and jumped on it with all my energy and creativity. I saw a lot of potential for colorful branding and use of energetic and vibrant photography. Managers saw my work and decided to give me an opportunity to bring all my ideas to life.

## Branding
I decided to blend the distinctive shape of the Istrian peninsula with all the experiences and photos one might have while visiting this amazing and unique region of Croatia. The campaign was distributed exclusively through digital channels so color choices were not restricted with print colors space.

### Typography
To complement the logo, I wanted a font that is quirky and sharp yet fun an friendly. Something that would unify a colorful logo and energetic photography. I decided to use Whitney, designed by famous Tobias Frere-Jones. It was a perfect match.

### Logo
To emphasize energy and movement I added small upward bend to the typography. This is the final result.

## Photography
One reason why I liked working on this project is that I was faced with a large number of photos. I enjoyed photography as it is a language on its own. So I insisted on using photos focused on one story and bold colors. Here are some examples.

## The website
As the project was separated in different stages, I decided to use a breadcrumbs-like path to lead visitor trough the story of what ShareIstria was and how to apply.

## The responsive design
The website features a fully responsive design, providing the same story experience across all devices.

## Conclusion
Share Istria was a project I enjoyed very much. I got to experience how is it to work on a large scale project. I was shocked to see how hard is it to find good and usable photographs in the era when everyone is a photographer. I realized how important it is to have a great development team or at least outsource development to the experienced agency.
