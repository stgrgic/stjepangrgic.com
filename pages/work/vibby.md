## Introduction
Vibby was a US based startup with offices in Zagreb (Croatia), and New York (US). It was a product from a group of brilliant college graduates, some of whom were world-class programmers. They wanted to build personalised and interactive online learning platform using online video. But there was a problem: an interactive online video didn't exist. So they decided to pivot and build just that. And that is a moment when I joined the team.

Before joining Vibby, I had no experience working in a startup. I was amazed by how many smart people worked there and how young the team was. They were all my age and just out of college.

### The challenge
How to make an online video more interactive? How to show only essential bits of video to the audience? At the time, I felt something could be done about it. I felt idea had potential and believed we could build something special.

<!-- ### The chalange
How to make video more interactive? How to show only important bits of video to the audinece? Looking pack to this question they feal unecesary, but at the time I fealt something can be done about it. I belived we could build something special. -->

### My role
I was the first and only designer on the team. So I was involved in every step of the process of creating a product. From rebranding to developing interactive wireframes. I worked on a web application user interface, website, presentations for investors and user experience of creating interactive videos.

## Experiences
Early on, we realised that creating an interactive online video from existing videos is going to be challenging. So we created two distinct experiences. Creating and watching.

### Vib Creation process
Vib creation was 3 part process of highlighting the most important/entertaining/informative/crazy parts of the video. We had to simplify steps several times as test users were not able to figure out how to do it in the first few iterations.

### Vibby player
Interactive player was secont part of equasion. We focused on showing to the audience that they are watching the shorter, more esential, form of original video. Apart from we added comments

## The final experience
I decided to blend the distinctive shape of the Istrian peninsula with all the experiences and photos one might have while visiting this amazing and unique region of Croatia. The campaign was distributed exclusively through digital channels so color choices were not restricted with print colors space.
