## Introduction
Vibby was a US startup with offices in Zagreb (Croatia), and New York (US). It was a product of a group of brilliant college graduates, some of whom were world-class programmers, that wanted to build personalized and interactive online learning platform using online video. But there was a problem: an interactive online video did not exist. So they decided to pivot and build just that. And that was the moment I joined.

Prior to joining Vibby, I had no experience working in startup. 
Until joinin vibby I had no startup experience.

### Vib Creation process
I decided to blend the distinctive shape of the Istrian peninsula with all the experiences and photos one might have while visiting this amazing and unique region of Croatia. The campaign was distributed exclusively through digital channels so color choices were not restricted with print colors space.
